# Research Papers Repository

This folder contains Markdown files of research papers that the Agentic IR system can use to answer questions.

## How to Add Papers

1. Convert research papers to Markdown format (`.md` files)
2. Place the files in this directory
3. Use clear, descriptive filenames (e.g., `transformer_architecture_2017.md`)

## Naming Conventions

For optimal retrieval, follow these naming conventions:
- Use lowercase letters and underscores
- Include the paper's main topic and year if possible
- Avoid spaces and special characters

## File Format

For best results, structure your Markdown files as follows:

```markdown
# Title of the Paper

## Authors
Author 1, Author 2, etc.

## Abstract
The abstract text goes here...

## Introduction

## Results

The Agentic IR system will be able to search through these papers and extract relevant information to answer your questions.
